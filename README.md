## Overview

This is a personal project where I implement features that I find necessary for managing the books I've shelved on Goodreads.com.

## Features

In the current version, the application offers the following features:

- **Book Listing**: View a list of your shelved books.
- **Author Listing**: Explore a list of authors and their works.
- **Bookshelf Overview**: See a list of your bookshelves.
- **Author's Works**: Access a page dedicated to an author's books.
- **Books in Specific Shelf**: View books that are shelved in a specific bookshelf.
- **Detailed Book Information**: Get in-depth details about each book on a dedicated page.
